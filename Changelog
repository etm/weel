1.99.x
-----

* Ruby >= 1.9.3 only, use Queue instead of Threads and Mutexes of Weel::Continue
* LGPL-3 to achive Apache 2 compatibility
* Raise Weel::Signal::Again in HandlerWrapper, to trigger Manipulation and then
redo the activity. HandlerWrapper is not discarded inbetween, so it is possible
to continue receiving multiple callbacks. Basically sequential multi instance
task.

Simulation support: #sim is like search mode but without search positions and
emits events trough HandlerWrapper

def simulate(type,nesting,tid,parent,parameters={})

type      : activity, choose, alternative, otherwise, parallel, parallel_branch, 
            mutex, loop
nesting   : :none (for activity), :start or :end (for all others)
tid       : trace id (unique element for every element)
parent    : for all nested element the tid of its parent
parameters: additinal information; for loops the mode (:head or :foot), for 
            choose the mode (:inclusive or :exclusive)

It is important to note, that parallel_branches are special. Parallel might
have loops and all kinds of stuff inside, that is always executed first - it
is logic to decide how many parallel branches are to be openend. Thus parallel
branches might have parents that are not the parent, but can be logically 
considered to be children of parallel for execution. The parent information
delivered for the simulation can be taken to decide if branches are created
in loops or decided upon in decisions (choose).

Similar to parallel, there can also be stuff inside the choose, that is not
'alternative' or 'otherwise'. Yet there the code is always executed as is. If 
simulation is used to generated traces, this stuff has to be considered as fixed
points (with the rest beeing variable). Special cases can again be, a variable number
of alternatives (with their own dynamic conditions)[1]. 

[1] Just in case you wonder: this can not be easily translated to a case with the
loop outside of the choose, when considering that the otherwise is executed
only when one of the alternatives is executed. This would require at least
additional script tasks in the alternatives that count the number of executed
alternatives.
